<p>As can be seen from reading the Strategic Initiatives, the LA County Library system is already on its way to emphasizing the educational role of libraries. For example, Strategic Initiative 2, Affirm the Library as a Center for Learning - Address our communities’ learning and literacy needs through classes, events and online technology, already uses words such as “learning”, “classes” and “events” to describe the offerings at the library. This initiative even goes so far as to call libraries centers for learning.

Additionally, the Strategic Initiatives refer to library users as “customers”. Gross (2013) asserts that the use of the term “customer” is beneficial to libraries because it “furthers [libraries’] quest to be perceived as a solid financial investment” (p. 37).

The LA County Library System’s Strategic Initiatives do an excellent job at utilizing a lexicon that makes their intended mission sound clear and valuable to the public, without using confusing library jargon. We would recommend only the following small tweaks to the language of Strategic Initiatives 1, 4 and 6:
 </p> 
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>However, serving a community of such a large population and diverse backgrounds certainly comes with its share of challenges.</p>
<p>As we know, representation matters and Los Angelas County Library must work hard to ensure adequate representation and materials to meet a wide range of patron needs.
