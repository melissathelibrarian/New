<h2>Analysis of the lexicon used at the LA County Library</h2>

 	<h3>Lexicon Changes Suggested by Valerie Gross</h3>

<p> 
In her 2013 book Transforming Our Image, Building Our Brand, author Valerie Gross makes a number of very specific recommendations geared towards shifting the lexicon of libraries away from traditional, and at times, dated and confusing terminology, towards a lexicon that will enable the public, and key stakeholders, to quickly see and realize the library’s valuable roll as an education center in their community. Gross asserts that this change in vocabulary will help to transform public perception of the library and transform that library’s image overall.</p>

<p>These suggestions will appear shocking at first to those of us who have been in the library world for a while, but are all designed to help libraries’ put their best foot forward.</p>

<h3>Examples from the website of where they’re doing what Gross says:</h3>
<p>Instead of labeling this section “circulation”, as most libraries would, LA County Library uses the term “borrowing”, which is one of Gross’ suggestions.</p><img src="images/borrowing.jpg">

<p>Here, LA County library uses the word “classes” for the events they host related to computers. This promotes the educational component.
