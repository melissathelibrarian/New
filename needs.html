<h2>Meeting Community Needs</h2>


<p>
LA County Library is working hard to meet the needs of their diverse patronage. It's not easy to determine the unique needs of a multicultural community, but LA County has discovered opportunities in which to serve particular user groups. One way they work to accomplish such a task is offering a wide variety of programming and resources designed for individual communities.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the majority of these programs have since been taken to the virtual world during the Covid-19 crisis, in order to continue serving patrons despite library closures.</p>
<h2>New Director, New Direction</h2>

    <blockquote>
        
<p>"Skye Patrick was appointed LA County Library Director on February 1, 2016. As the Library Director, Patrick brings a fresh enthusiasm and attitude to her position. From the start of her tenure, she engaged the community with a series of Visioning Sessions—a concept first conceived at Broward—which invited the public to meet with her to discuss what they’d envision their local library to offer.</p>

She has made it her mission to break down barriers and increase access for all by introducing the iCount equity initiative, which ensures that LA County Library makes a conscious effort in designing services and programs that address the needs of the diverse community it serves. Under her leadership, local libraries are intentionally designing programs in systematic ways and Library staff is empowered to address issues with a more consistent and comprehensive approach" (About Us, 2018).</p>

		<h2>Keeping up with Trends</h2>

		<p>The LA County Library system is working hard to stay on top of trends in order to provide cutting-edge, innovative resources. Bookmobiles (there are 3 of them!) work to serve rural and homebound populations, supplying not only the traditional materials, but also access to information in the form of mobile wifi hotspots they lend to patrons. Makerspaces are complete with the newest technologies and staff on hand to teach classes and guide patrons in using the materials; most recently these spaces have been converted to production sites for personal protective equipment. Proving once again to be an invaluable resource, the library's response to the Pandemic Crisis has been swift and thorough. We thought it was imortant to include a <a href="covid.php"> page to highlight the library's response to Covid-19</a>.</p>
