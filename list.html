<p>The Los Angeles Public Library serves one of the largest communities in the United States, with a population of over 10 million people. The library itself serves over 3 million citizens in this diverse, multicultural city; circulation nears 10 million on an annual basis. It can be quite the task serving so many patrons from such diverse backgrounds, however, Los Angeles County Public Library proves itself to be the backbone of the community, time and again by providing innovative services, programming, and resources for this unique community. </p>

<p>However, serving a community of such a large population and diverse backgrounds certainly comes with its share of challenges.</p>
<p>As we know, representation matters and LA County Library must work hard to ensure adequate representation and materials to meet a wide range of patron needs. From the data, we know that in order to best serve the community the library will need to:
<ol>
<li>Provide outreach to the communities they are not reaching with traditional services</li>
<li>Ensure that staff people speak multiple languages</li>
<li>Create programming that meets the needs of underserved communities</li>
<li>Partner with local organizations to reach patrons experiencing homelessness</li>
<li>Offer a wide-range of materials, in various languages and formats</li>
</ol>
<p> The data you see below demonstrates the diversity of the patrons the library serves. </p>
