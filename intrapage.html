		<h2>Rising to the Challenge</h2>

<div><p>
Amy Garmer’s Rising to the Challenge: Re-Envisioning Public Libraries (2014) examines how public libraries are exceptionally positioned to serve the needs of their communities and provides “four strategic opportunities for action” that libraries and communities can address together. Garmer also authored Libraries in the Exponential Age: Moving from the Edge of Innovation to the Center of Community (2016), where she further explores ways in which public libraries can adapt to their communities’ needs during a time of rapid technological change.
 
So how does the LA County Library stack up? According to Garmer (2014), “[p]ublic libraries that align their people, place and platform assets and create services that prioritize and support local community goals will find the greatest opportunities for success in the years ahead” (p.34).</p>

<em>Garmer’s first strategy for success</em> is “aligning library services in support of community goals” (2014, p.34). 
In 2016, the LA County Library introduced the “Your Voice, Your Library, Your Community” initiative, which involved community visioning sessions in each of the individual communities the library serves. A combination of town-hall style meetings, feedback boards, and online forms resulted in a number of new and expanded programs and services that sought to better serve the communities in LA County. 
	
<br>
<em>The second strategy for success </em> is “providing access to content in all formats” (Garmer, 2014, p.36). An entire section of the LA County Library’s website, labeled the Digital Library, is dedicated to its impressive array of materials available in multiple formats. It offers everything from eBooks, audiobooks, movies, music, TV shows, and magazines to numerous online learning courses. Their Digital Collections include an amazing array of digitized materials that document the rich culture and history of LA County. According to their website, the library “digitizes rare and unique materials from its own collections, partners with other county departments to provide access to county materials of historical interest, and collaborates with the communities it serves to create local history materials that reflect the historical experiences of Los Angeles County residents” (LA County Library, n.d.). <figure>

</br>

<p>Once again, by collaborating with local organizations and providing free access to technology, the LA County Library embraces the concept of superconnectivity and  “recognizes the need to address the wealth gap in order to overcome the inequality of access, inclusion, and engagement” (Garmer, 2016, p.5). 

<p>
<em>Garmer’s third strategy of success </em>is “[e]nsuring long-term sustainability for public libraries” (2014, p.39). A large part of this strategy is about securing the funding that public libraries need in order to survive and thrive. Since the LA County Library serves approximately 3.5 million users, its financial burden is high. In 1982, the <a href="https://www.lacolibraryfoundation.org/">LA County Library Foundation</a>, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, was formed to raise funds necessary to support the library’s programs, materials, and services. As it states on its website, public funds don’t cover all of the library’s needs.
<p>
Library Director Skye Patrick has done a remarkable job raising money for the library and collaborating with local organizations; before she was hired, “the library was facing a deficit. Yet in the short two and a half years of her management, she has raised more than $30 million in grants, expanded mobile programming, and adjusted staffing to expand service hours across 75 of the system’s locations at no additional cost to taxpayers, largely through administrative reorganization” (Berry, 2018). </p>
<p>
But even though the LA County Library has been doing a fantastic job securing the funding necessary for all of the impressive projects and materials that it offers, they also, like most public libraries in the U.S., don’t have all the funding they would like (or require) to be able to serve their communities in even more beneficial and needed ways. As the LA County Library Foundation points out, the coronavirus wasn’t in the budget. While this is true for every public library, it is one of the challenges that the LA County Library faces now, and in the future. 
</p>
<p><em>The final strategy</em> that Garmer recommends for the continuing success of public libraries is the cultivation of leadership. Library leaders, as Garmer (2014) notes, “will need to design transformative change and become experts in their communities” (p.45). In addition to being able to understand and adapt to the needs of their communities, it is also vital that library leaders foster environments of racial equity, both in the communities they serve and in the libraries they oversee. Skye Patrick, Library Director of the LA County Library, has broken down barriers and engaged with her community since she was hired in 2016. <figure>

</br>

In fact, Patrick was named the 2019 Librarian of the Year by Library Journal for her exceptional work with the diverse communities that the LA County Library serves. Los Angeles County is one of the most racially diverse in the nation: the population is 48 percent Latinx, 28 percent non-Latinx white, 14 percent Asian, nine percent African American, 22 percent other races, and five percent from two or more races (Berry, 2018). Patrick herself is the first African-American to be appointed as Library Director of the LA County Library, and is the first LGTBQ member to hold the position, as well. Her achievement is a notable one, since according to Sonnie (2018), “88 percent of librarians are white, as are 73 percent of library assistants” (p.11). 

One of Patrick’s most influential initiatives is an equity initiative called iCount, a staff training initiative that seeks to ensure that “the Library makes a conscious effort in designing programs that address the needs of its diverse residents” (LA County Library, n.d.). In 2017, an Equity Training Toolkit was created and shared with library supervisors, who then conducted training with their staff. By empowering staff, the library has made sure that its community members are getting the resources they need.

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3>
In terms of rising to the challenge of serving the needs of the diverse communities it serves and implementing best practices for advancing racial equity in public libraries, the LA County Library ticks off all the boxes. While it undoubtedly faces challenges and will continue to face challenges in the future (COVID-19 being one of them), it has positioned itself to tackle these problems with strong leadership and an understanding that connecting with and serving the people who live in its diverse communities is what makes it special.

	<h2>The Source</h2>
	<p>This diverse selection of online resources along with access to free WiFi, wireless printers, a library app, and computers is in line with Garmer’s (2016) observation that public libraries “are uniquely positioned to provide ‘superconnectivity’ across the entire community” (p.30). By providing free access to technology, the LA County Library is helping to bridge the digital divide and encourage community engagement. 

But the LA County Library is a “superconnected” library not just because it provides access to technology, but also because it’s made a commitment to making its talented staff, in collaboration with local organizations, available to the community. For instance, each month they host “The Source,” a pop-up resource fair that pulls together a variety of resources beneficial to the homeless or at-risk populations of the communities they serve. This is a great example of how the LA County Library is implementing Garmer’s (2016) idea of staff being “re-imagined as community activators who facilitate the development of relationships and collaboration” (p.5).
